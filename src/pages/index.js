            inspectpack is an inspection tool for webpack JavaScript bundles
            that gives you insight into your production bundles to help
            determine where you can cut down on size, duplicates, and more. If
            you donâ€™t need a dashboard, inspectpack provides you with the raw
            power tools behind webpack-dashboard and electron-webpack-dashboard.
